# Login Test Instructions

## What Was Fixed
1. **Authentication State Management**: Added proper server-side cookie authentication
2. **Token Persistence**: Token is now saved to localStorage 
3. **Navigation**: Changed redirect to `/dashboard` instead of `/` with delay for auth propagation
4. **Render Mode**: Set InteractiveServer mode for proper event handling

## Steps to Test

1. **Restart the Web Application**
   ```bash
   # Stop existing process
   pkill -f "dotnet.*Web" 
   
   # Start fresh
   cd /Users/vikas/Code/published/devview/Web
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Clear localStorage
   - Clear cookies for localhost

3. **Test Login**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5084/login
   - Enter credentials:
     - Username: `user`
     - Password: `User#12345!`
   - Click "Sign in"

4. **Expected Result**
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Should NOT redirect back to login
   - Check localStorage in DevTools - should see `jwt-token` key

## Debugging

If login still redirects back:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12)
   - Look for `[AuthService]` logs
   - Should see "Login successful" and "Server-side authentication cookie set"

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Login request should return 200 OK
   - Response should contain token, displayName, and roles

3. **Check Application Tab**
   - localStorage should have `jwt-token` 
   - Cookies should have authentication cookie

4. **Alternative Test**
   - Try http://localhost:5084/test-login
   - This bypasses all the UI complexity and tests API directly

## The Core Issue Was

The authentication state wasn't being properly established on the server side. After successful login:
- JWT token was received ✅
- Client-side state was updated ✅ 
- But server-side cookie wasn't set ❌
- So navigation to protected routes failed and redirected back to login

Now with the fixes:
- JWT token is saved to localStorage
- Server-side cookie is set via HttpContext.SignInAsync
- Authentication state provider is updated
- Small delay ensures state propagation before navigation
